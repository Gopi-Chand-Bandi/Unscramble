# Unscramble
This is simply a game in which we need to Unscramble the words.
The words are generated randomly from the Oxford dictionary.So that the word which appears one will won't come more than once.
For every correct answer we will get a 20 points.
There is a Skip button and Submit button.
If we don't know the answer then we can simply press the skip button.
At last we will get a score card based on all 10 words we solved.
